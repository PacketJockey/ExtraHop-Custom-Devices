This project is used to integrate Reveal(x) with AT&T Cyber Security's Open Threat Exchange (OTX) API.  
The Notebook will connect to a specific OTX Pulse and import the Observables into the ExtraHop Memcached.  From there transactions that are relevant to the observables (Domains, URLs, IP Addresses) can be used to check against future transactions to see if there are any matches.
